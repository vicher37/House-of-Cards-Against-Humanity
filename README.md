===============================

Instuctions on how to run this project

Step 1 – open Python 2.7.8 (There will be minor malfunction if you run it in Python 3.4.1)

Step 2 – open question.py (the file for classes)

Step 3 – open The game.py (the program file) and run it. You will see a hint, a question, and 1 or 2 answer(s) (2 seconds of pause after each step), and then the program will ask you whether you want to continue, and you will also be able to rate the answer if you want to. Be sure to input ‘y’ or ‘n’ or ‘a’ with quotation marks.
